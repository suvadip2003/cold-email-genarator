            4.  **Paragraph 2 (Connection & Value):** In one or two sentences, state admiration for the company's work (infer this from the job description) and explicitly state the desire to contribute their specific skills to the team.
            5.  **Paragraph 3 (Call to Action):** Mention that the resume and portfolio are attached/linked and ask for a quick call to explore opportunities.
            6.  **Signature:** Format the signature exactly as shown below, with each part on a new line.

            ### RULES:
            - Keep the email body concise and professional.
            - Do not add any preamble or text before the "Subject:" line.
            
            ### SIGNATURE FORMAT:
            Best regards,
