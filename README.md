## üöÄ How It Works
The application follows a simple but powerful workflow:
1.  **User Input:** The user provides their personal information in the sidebar and a job description in the main text area.
2.  **LLM Processing:** When the "Generate Email" button is clicked, the job description and user info are sent to the Groq API via a structured LangChain prompt.
3.  **Content Generation:** The Llama 3 model analyzes the context and generates a personalized cold email based on the engineered prompt.
4.  **Display:** The final, formatted email is displayed in the Streamlit interface.
